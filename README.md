# Realtime_Emotion_Detection
This project aims to develop a real-time facial emotion recognition system in TensorFlow using transfer learning. Utilizing the FER 2013 dataset, a comprehensive collection of various facial expressions, the goal of the project is to train and fine-tune MobileNetV2, a lightweight yet highly efficient feature extraction architecture. Transfer learning is used to adapt and optimise the MobileNetNetV2 model, which is pre-trained to recognise and classify seven fundamental human emotions in real time: anger; disgust; fear; happiness; sadness; surprise; and neutral states. The goal of the proposed system is to achieve high-quality performance in the recognition and analysis of subtle facial expressions, increasing the potential of applications in various domains such as Human-Computer Interaction, Market Research, and Mental Health Assessment. The methodology of the project includes data preprocessing and model training and validation, as well as performance evaluation.
